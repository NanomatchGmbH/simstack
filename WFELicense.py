You may distribute the modifications themselves (e.g. as "patches") under terms of your choice. 
We encourage users to contribute modifications back into the Software,

with the provision of consultancy, modeling or other services, whether for value or 
otherwise, on behalf of any third party who does not hold a current valid 
Simona Software License Agreement. You shall not use the Software to write other software
that duplicates the functionality of the Software. You shall not rent, lease, or otherwise

LIMITED WARRANTY. LICENSEE acknowledges that LICENSORS make no warranty, expressed or implied, 
that the program will function without error, or in any particular hardware environment, 
or so as to generate any particular function or result, and further excluding any other 
warranty, as to the condition of the program, its merchantability, or its fitness for a 
particular purpose. LICENSORS shall not be liable for any direct, consequential, or 
other damages suffered by the LICENSEE or any others as a result of their use of the 
program, whether or not the same could have been foreseen by LICENSORS prior to granting 
this License. In no event shall LICENSORS liability for any breach of this agreement 
exceed the fee paid for the license. 

LICENSOR LIABILITY. In no event shall the LICENSOR be liable  
for any indirect, special, or consequential damages, such as, but not limited to, 
loss of anticipated profits or other economic loss in connection with or arising out of 
the use of the software by you or the services provided for in this Agreement, 
even if the LICENSOR has been advised of the possibility of such damages. 
The LICENSORS's entire liability and your exclusive remedy shall be, at the 
LICENSORS's discretion, to return the Software and proof of purchase to the 
LICENSOR for either (a) return of any license fee, or (b) correction or replacement 
of Software that does not meet the terms of this limited warranty. 
NO OTHER WARRANTIES. The LICENSOR disclaims other implied warranties, including, 
but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability or fitness for any purpose, and 
implied warranties arising by usage of trade, course of dealing, or course of performance. 
Some states do not allow the limitation of the duration or liability of implied warranties, 
so the above restrictions might not apply to you. 

LICENSE FEE. In order to use this software you must enter a separate licence 
agreement with the LICENSOR which designates the license fee.
